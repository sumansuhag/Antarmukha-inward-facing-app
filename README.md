# Antarmukha-inward-facing-app
Antarmukha (inward-facing) app embodies silence over sound for consciousness dissolution.

# Panchakshari Mahavidya Analysis

The Panchakshari mantra "Namah Shivaya" originates from the Shri Rudram in the Yajurveda's Rudra section, serving as a profound tool for consciousness dissolution in Vedic tradition. 

## Linguistic Breakdown

"Namah" goes beyond "salutations," parsed as "Na" (negation) + "Mah" (ego magnitude), mirroring "Manah" (mind), symbolizing mind reversal and dissolution during chanting. "Shivaya" refers to the unchanging, auspicious pure awareness (Shiva), directing a return to this ground state. 

## Metaphysical Process

Chanting follows ontological dissolution: active mind makes the world seem real, then mind dissolves along with five elements (earth to space), leaving Shiva as undivided consciousness. 

## App Blueprint: Antarmukha
